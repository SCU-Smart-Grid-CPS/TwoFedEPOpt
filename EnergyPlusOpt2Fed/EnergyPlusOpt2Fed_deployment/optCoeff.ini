#  Updated:     2021-11-06
#  Version:     0.2   |   Simversion 5.51
#
#  Added Diffuse Solar, c4 to some. Will add more over time. 
#  Indoor temperature prediction config file. Allows for different constants 
#	depending on location and heating vs cooling without constantly rewriting the program.
#  Also includes pricing coefficients
#  Compatible with ConfigParser and V5.3 and newer of the optimization sim

# Syntax: 
#	Hashtag to comment
# 	No comments on same line as any floats, doubles, or int data because ConfigParser doesn't recognize comments in a value 
#		ex: don't do this: 
#			c1 = 3 #test
#	For temperature prediction coefficients, use brackets as headers for each set of c vals: 
#		[LOCATION_c] for cooling
#		[LOCATION_h] for heating
#		list c1, c2, c3 on separate lines under the associated heading
#	For Pricing Coefficients, see specific section

# Pricing Constants -----------------------------------------------------------
[Pricing_Constants]
PRICING_MULTIPLIER = 8.0
#4.0 Changed to try to make optimization more effective (from Dr. Lee suggestion)
PRICING_OFFSET = 0.02 
#0.10


# Indoor Temperature Prediction Coefficients -----------------------------------
